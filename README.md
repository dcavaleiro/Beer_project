# 🍺 Beer Project: Graph Database Analysis of Beers and Breweries

This project utilizes a graph database approach to analyze relationships between beers, breweries, and related attributes. By modeling the data as a graph, we can uncover insights into the beer industry, such as identifying popular beer styles, exploring brewery collaborations, and understanding regional beer distributions.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `BDMM_HOMEWORK_1_Final_2024.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data modeling, analysis, and visualization of the beer and brewery graph.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: `pandas`
  - Graph Analysis: `networkx`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

The analysis includes:

- **Data Modeling**: Representing beers, breweries, and their relationships as nodes and edges in a graph.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the properties of the graph, such as node degrees, centrality measures, and community structures.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the graph to identify patterns and clusters.
- **Insights**: Deriving meaningful conclusions about the beer industry based on the graph analysis.
